## Explication

I have always tried to grow plants(chili, salad, basil etc..) over the years.
I have noticed that this idea is very difficult to realize, for various reasons: little space, little green thumb, but
the biggest problem is the lack of time.  
Domotic garden could solve this problem!

My idea is to create a small greenhouse, capable of reproducing an ecosystem functional to the growth of
different plants.
With the use of sensors, placed in the pots of the plants and in the greenhouse, I want to manage all the parameters useful for a plant to grow.
With these sensors, I can monitor:

* Temperature(Thermostat);
* Light intensity(Brightness);
* Soil humidity(Soil moisture).

After taking this data, the idea is to activate other sensors, placed inside the greenhouse.
The sensors inside the greenhouse are:

* Lamp;
* Sprinkler;
* Calorificator.

These sensors are activated with a precise purpose, based on certain information
about growing potted plants.
I get this information from sites with true and real data.

## Infrastructure

This is my idea of infrastructure that I imagined, surely I will be forced to change it in the development phase.
